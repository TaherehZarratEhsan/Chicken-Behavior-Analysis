# Chicken-Behavior-Analysis
#### Winner of Scientific-Industrial Computer Vision Competition in 12th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (Second Place), 2022. 
#### The goal of this competition was to propose a machine-learning framework for chicken behavior analysis and the framework must comprise the following parts: 
###### 1- Chicken detection in a crowded challenging poultry environment 
###### 2- Tracker to find the trajectory of detected chickens 
###### 3- Chicken behavior analysis based on the trajectory evaluation
