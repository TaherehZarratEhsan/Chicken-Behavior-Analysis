# Chicken Behavior Analysis
#### Winner of Scientific-Industrial Computer Vision Competition in 12th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (Second Place), 2022.   
The goal of this competition was to propose a machine-learning framework for chicken behavior analysis and the framework must comprise the following parts:     
1- Chicken detection in a crowded challenging poultry environment   
2- Tracker to find the trajectory of detected chickens   
3- Chicken behavior analysis based on the trajectory evaluation
